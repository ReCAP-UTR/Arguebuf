# Arguebuf

Arguebuf is a format defined with Protocol Buffers to encode structured argument graphs.
The overall project is a combination of multiple repositories that complement each other:

- [Protobuf Specification](https://github.com/recap-utr/arg-services/blob/main/proto/arg_services/graph/v1/graph.proto)
- [Advanced Python Library](https://github.com/recap-utr/arguebuf-python)
- [Command Line Interface](https://github.com/recap-utr/arguebuf-cli)
